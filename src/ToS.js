              <li>
                <p>Our Purpose: Spare is an online software provider that optimally matches Renters and Hosts to share storage space on our Website. We organize bookings for storage, and help process the Contract and transactions between the two parties (“Renter” and “Host”). The Company is definitely not a rental agent or property broker; Spare simply serves to link users together and is not directly considered a party in the Contract between the Host and the Renter.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We reserve all rights to disable your account and remove any Listing for any reason at our sole discretion. These reasons may include, but are not limited to, Listings that are objectionable or in violation of the Terms. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Spare does not directly support or endorse any particular Host, Renter, Listing, or User.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The laws of the State of Massachusetts, United States of America apply to these Terms of Use. All Users, Hosts, Renters, and other affiliated parties submit exclusively to the courts of that specific jurisdiction.</p>

            <h4> User Obligations </h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p> Website registration requires each User to sign up with their name, email address, and password, or log in via Facebook. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>In order to create the account, you are required to verify your identity through email. You warrant that the personal information on your account is indeed your own.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>As soon as a Host submits a Listing (registering his/her Space), he/she offers a legally binding Contract with the Renter. Hosts may edit the Space listed on the Website at any time, unless the Space has been booked or is being rented through a Contract. If a Host cancels or breaks a Contract that has already been processed, he/she must pay back the full Spare Rent and Spare Commission to the Renter.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Obligations of the Host</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p> When creating a Listing, the Host must include (if at all applicable):
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Size of Space (Dimensions)

                      Additional Text Description and Images (Optional)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  All of the above must be described in an accurate, complete, and up-to-date manner. The information must be truthful to the best of your knowledge. If there are significant deviations from the characteristics of the Space described in your Listing reported, you must refund all payment (if received already). Spare reserves all rights to make this determination.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>In the case that the Space becomes unavailable for any given reason, you must remove the Listing as soon as possible.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>You agree that you are fully responsible for all Spaces that you register. You warrant that all Listings you post, along with the Renter’s use of your Space:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Will not breach any agreements you have entered or are planning to enter with any third party, and not conflict with the rights of any third party.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Will comply with all applicable laws, tax requirements, rules, and regulations that may apply to any Space you register. This includes, but is not limited to, zoning laws and laws governing rentals or sub-leasing of residential and other properties.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Host can choose two types of access for any given Listing.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Full Private Access: This gives permanent access of the storage space to the Renter during the dates specified on the contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Partial Access: Renter can only access the Space by giving notice to and being accompanied by the Host.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>When Full Private Access is provided by the Host, the Renter is fully responsible for all damage caused to the Space by the objects stored or by any careless act of the Renter. In the unlikely event that damage is caused to the Space, the Renter must pay compensation for all damage done, including reasonable repairs, and/or replacement where the Space is damaged beyond repair.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>When Partial Access is provided, the Host is fully responsible for the restoration of all goods stored in the state they were in at the beginning of storage, upon request by the Renter. The Host has the obligation to inform - without any delay - the Renter about any damage or loss he/she can find on the deposited assets.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Hosts must never insist, ask, or suggest that a Renter pays any part of the Spare Rent directly to the Host through cash, check, or any other payment method than by payment through Spare.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Host is fully responsible for Space that he/she lists on the Website. The Host must hold a valid and reasonable home and contents insurance on the Space and/or property that the Space is located in. Spare encourages that the Host inform and confirm with the insurance provider responsible in order to check if the insurance applies, and understand the details of its coverage before creating a Listing.</p>

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Obligations of the Renter</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>When you create a Contract with a Host, you warrant that you are not renting the Space with the purpose of storing Prohibited Goods or any other illegal uses. You agree that the sole purpose of renting a Space is for the storage of personal belongings and you will not store anything that will cause significant inconvenience for the Host.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Renter promises to pay the full Spare Rent without delay using the online payment transaction system through the Website upon reservation of Space. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Renter must comply with all security arrangements and access rules set in place as noted in the Contract. He/she is also responsible to pay for any damage, destruction, or loss of access/security items such as keys while in possession of them. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>By the end of the reservation period on the Contract, or upon the correct termination of a Contract under Clause 8, the Renter agrees to fully vacate all belongings from the Space. The Renter must also return the part of the Space that he/she rented as clean as it had been at the time of entering the Space.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Renter must remove all stored belongings from the Space upon request by the Host, provided that the Host followed the terms described in Clause 8. </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Obligations of Spare</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Upon successful reservation of a Space and a Contract in place between the Host and the Renter, Spare will collect the Spare Rent from the Renter. Payment during the whole transaction process will be processed by an electronic payment system (Stripe), which is set in place on the Website. Spare will not confirm a reservation unless we have received the payment. By using our payment system, the User must confirm that he/she agrees to the terms and conditions of the electronic payment service as well.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Once Spare Rent is received, Spare will take the Spare Commission, and then send the remaining amount to the Host through the electronic payment system within three (3) days of the Renter moving out.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Changes, Cancellations, and Terminations of Lease</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>If the Contract has not commenced (the start date of storage has not passed), either Host or Renter can cancel the Contract without penalty within five (5) days of reservation confirmation (“Grace Period”). All payments already made will be refunded through the electronic payment system. If the Host cancels the reservation under this scenario, he/she will not receive any Spare Rent payments for that specific booking.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Both parties, Renter and Host, must give a thirty (30) days’ notice in order to cancel a Contract outside of the Grace Period. The User must notify the other party and terminate the Contract through the Website.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Termination by Renter: The Renter must continue to pay the Spare Rent during the remaining thirty (30) days until the Contract has been fully terminated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Termination by Host: The Host must continue to store the Renter’s belongings if they are already located in the Space for at least an additional thirty (30) days. The Host agrees that he/she will forfeit the Spare Rent receivable for those thirty (30) days.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>In the case that the Host or Renter breaks an obligation under these Terms of Use or the Contract, Clause 8.2 will not apply. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>As a Host, you have reasonable doubt that the Renter is storing one or more items listed under Prohibited Goods in Clause 2.8, or any item that is in breach of these Terms of Use, you have full right to immediately terminate the Contract. However, the Host must give a reasonable notice to the Renter, and a chance for the Renter to remove the items in suspicion. If the problem has not been solved after notifying the Renter, the Host may also inform law enforcement authorities and take necessary actions to remove the items from their property.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If the Renter does not remove the Stored Goods after the expiration or termination of a Contract and reasonable notice, the Host has full right to remove the items from his/her property. The Renter forfeits all of his/her items in this situation.</p>
